#Table with paths (in the form of XPath) that select tags from input XML files which are to be obfuscated. Form of each record in the table is A.B=C where A is name of the responseType, B is name of particular XPath selection (for better readability) and C is XPath string in the form of Java String, it means that e.g. character "=" must be encoded to "\=". Each XPath selection applies only to the particular response type defined as A. A can contain ".", actually last "." separates A and B.
